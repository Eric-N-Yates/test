  <h1>Bullying in the Workplace: New Management and the Dismantling of Institutional Integrity</h1>
</header>


  <main>
    <p>When a new management team takes over, employees often hope for fresh ideas, better leadership, and a more effective organization. Unfortunately, in some cases, new leadership may instead use workplace bullying as a means to consolidate power, remove perceived threats, and create an environment that serves their own financial interests. Two departments often targeted in this process are Finance and Human Resources.</p>

    <p>This pattern is not unlike what happens when authoritarian leaders take over governments. This is especially true in cases where leadership transitions involve individuals from outside the existing corporate structure, or when leaders see themselves as 'outsiders' to the established institutional order. These new leaders will often use bullying and intimidation as tools to remove perceived threats, thereby consolidating their control.A well-documented example is Donald Trump’s presidency, where institutional checks and balances were systematically attacked to centralize power. Just as Trump used intimidation and loyalty tests to weaken oversight institutions, corporate leadership teams can dismantle internal controls through similar tactics.</p>

    <h2>Intimidation of the Finance Department</h2>
    <p>The Finance team is responsible for enforcing financial discipline and preventing fraud. But a management team bent on personal gain often sees Finance as an obstacle.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Targeting finance professionals for minor errors while ignoring misconduct elsewhere</li>
      <li>Overloading finance staff with excessive work to reduce oversight ability</li>
      <li>Excluding Finance from strategic decision-making meetings</li>
      <li>Punishing ethical objections to questionable financial decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Typical misconduct includes inflated bonuses, payments to related parties, employment of family members at high salaries, and allowing relatives to use company facilities like personal property.</p>

    <h2>Manipulating Human Resources</h2>
    <p>Rather than confront HR directly, new leadership often uses charm and incentives to neutralize its oversight function.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flattering HR leadership to gain favor</li>
      <li>Offering promotions or pay raises in exchange for compliance</li>
      <li>Bypassing HR in disciplinary or hiring decisions</li>
      <li>Redefining ethical behavior as a need for "agility"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This mirrors Trump’s approach to the DOJ and Pentagon—installing loyalists and rendering them tools for authority, not accountability.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Cult of Leadership</h2>
    <p>Once control is solidified, a cult-like reverence often forms around the top leader. They may present themselves as the owner or ultimate authority in the company. Loyalty trumps merit, and the leader’s image becomes central to all messaging. Family members and close allies form an inner circle of power, using company facilities freely and wielding informal influence.</p>

    <h2>The Illusion of Progress: The DOGE Strategy</h2>
    <p>New management often launches an initiative under a catchy acronym—like DOGE (Delivering Outstanding Growth Efficiently)—to present an image of reform. In truth, these plans are typically just mechanisms to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take credit for pre-existing improvements</li>
      <li>Suppress or rewrite history to criticize past leadership</li>
      <li>Enforce scripted talking points among team members</li>
      <li>Create media or internal PR that suggests success has been achieved</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Much like Trump’s efforts to brand economic gains as his own while vilifying previous administrations, corporate leadership may present a carefully controlled narrative that suppresses dissent and elevates self-promotion over substance.</p>

    <h2>Bullying Women and Minorities</h2>
    <p>Authoritarian corporate cultures often marginalize women and racial minorities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Women are placed in token roles as decorative elements in meetings</li>
      <li>Minority employees are excluded from real power and their accomplishments ignored</li>
      <li>The leadership team forms a homogenous "clique" of friends and family</li>
      <li>Diversity is used for optics, not inclusion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These dynamics mirror broader patterns in populist and authoritarian regimes, where control is maintained by erasing institutional checks and favoring loyalists above all.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Workplace bullying, when used as a leadership strategy, leads to a culture of fear, inefficiency, and ethical decay. Financial manipulation, marginalization of controls like HR, and cult-like leadership reverence degrade both morale and business performance.</p>
